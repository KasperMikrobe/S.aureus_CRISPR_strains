# S.aureus_CRISPR_strains
All primary S. aureus isolates are recovered from Danish patients who were admitted due to a healthcare-associated infection between 27th of October 2017 and 12th of March 2019. All isolates were typed at Statens Serum Institut as part of the national MRSA surveillance program.
All isolates were whole-genome sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq with 2 x 251 bp paired-end reads. Isolates were assembled using SKESA or SPAdes.
